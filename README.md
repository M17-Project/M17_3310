# M17_3310

> The board's thickness is 1.0mm. Anything thicker **will not** fit.

## Original mainboard photos
Both photos in the `misc` directory are cropped, so that if you scale them for 108mm height, you should be able to make direct measurements using GIMP or other image editing software.

## Firmware
